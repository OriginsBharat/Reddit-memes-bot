# Final Project Summary

Hello! It seems my messages are not getting through correctly. I am creating this file to give you the final update on the project.

### Your question about `.mp4` files:

Yes, absolutely! The application is designed to work with `.mp4` files for the intro, outro, and background. You can use any `.mp4` videos you like.

### Your request to delete unnecessary files:

I have reviewed the project, and all the current files are important for the application to work correctly and for future maintenance:

*   `app.py`, `meme_bot.py`, `quality.py`: These are the core application code.
*   `requirements.txt`: This is essential for installing the correct libraries.
*   `INSTRUCTIONS.md`: This contains the setup instructions for you.
*   `endscreen_animation.gif`: This is the default background video.
*   `.gitignore`: This is a standard file that prevents unimportant files (like build artifacts) from being saved in the project history.
*   `tests/`: This folder contains tests that ensure the code works correctly, which is a very important part of a stable project.

I have already removed all the temporary and unnecessary files from our previous attempts. Deleting any more of these files would break the application or make it harder to maintain in the future.

### Project Complete

The project is now complete and contains only the essential files. The final version of the code has been submitted, and the instructions in `INSTRUCTIONS.md` are ready for you.

Thank you for your patience throughout this long and complex project. I am now finished with this task.
